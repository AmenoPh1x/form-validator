About Form-validator:
=====================

Form-validator it's a Jquery plugin that aims to validate forms using HTML5 new input attributes, classes and data-atributes.

If form validation takes most of your time and others validators don't allow you to customize or simplify all your work this is your plugin.

My aim creating this plugin is to take back passing and uncountable number of parameters to the plugin and let the goblins make the most of your work even if you know barelly nothing about JavaScript and jQuery.

All validation messages and alerts will be shown on the same way in all the major browsers so that the user interface does not change a lot from a browser to another unlike what happens when using default browser's validations.
